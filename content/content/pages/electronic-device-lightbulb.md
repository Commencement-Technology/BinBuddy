Recycling light bulbs is an important step in reducing waste and preserving the environment. In Brookhaven, NY, there are several ways to recycle different types of light bulbs. Here is a detailed guide on how to recycle light bulbs in Brookhaven, NY:

1. Incandescent light bulbs: Incandescent light bulbs are not recyclable and should be disposed of in your regular trash.

You can bring these bulbs to a Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) event in Brookhaven, NY. The Brookhaven HHW program is open to residents of the town and operates on a seasonal schedule. Check the Brookhaven town website or contact the Department of Recycling and Sustainable Materials Management for the schedule and location of the next HHW event.
