The proper way to dispose of medicine in Brookhaven, NY is through the Brookhaven Prescription Drug Take-Back Program. Here are the steps to dispose of medicine through this program:

1. Gather all unused or expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and veterinary medications that you want to dispose of.

2. Remove all personal information from the medication containers, including your name, address, and prescription number.

3. Take the medication to a Brookhaven Prescription Drug Take-Back Program drop-off location. These locations can be found at local pharmacies, police stations, and town halls.

4. Once you arrive at the drop-off location, give the medication to the staff or volunteers who are present. They will dispose of the medication safely and securely.

5. If you cannot make it to a drop-off location, you can dispose of medication at home. Mix the medication with an undesirable substance, such as dirt, coffee grounds, or cat litter. Then, seal the mixture in a plastic bag or container and dispose of it in the trash.

It is important to properly dispose of medication to prevent accidental ingestion or misuse. Additionally, improper disposal can harm the environment by contaminating water sources and harming wildlife.
