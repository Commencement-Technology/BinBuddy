The Town of Brookhaven in New York provides several options for recycling plastic bags. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Collect your plastic bags: Gather all the plastic bags you want to recycle. These can include grocery bags, bread bags, produce bags, dry-cleaning bags, and any other clean and dry plastic bags.

2. Check if your bags are acceptable for recycling: Make sure that the plastic bags you are recycling are accepted by the recycling program. The following types of bags are accepted:

-   Grocery bags
-   Retail bags (with string ties or rigid plastic handles removed)
-   Bread bags
-   Produce bags
-   Newspaper sleeves
-   Dry-cleaning bags

3. Clean and dry the bags: Make sure that the bags are clean and dry. Any food or liquid left in the bags can contaminate the recycling process, and wet bags can cause mold and mildew.

4. Prepare the bags for recycling: Flatten the bags and tie them together into a ball the size of a basketball or larger. This will prevent them from getting caught in the recycling machinery.

5. Find a recycling drop-off location: The Town of Brookhaven provides several recycling drop-off locations where you can bring your plastic bags. Here are some of the options:

-   Local supermarkets: Many supermarkets, such as Stop & Shop, Target, and Walmart, have recycling bins for plastic bags in their stores.
-   Town Recycling Centers: The Town of Brookhaven operates five Recycling Centers where you can drop off your plastic bags. You can find the location nearest to you on the town's website.
-   Recycling events: The Town of Brookhaven also holds recycling events throughout the year where you can drop off your plastic bags, among other items. Check the town's website for upcoming events.

6. Drop off your bags: Bring your bags to the recycling drop-off location and place them in the designated bin or container. Make sure that you only recycle plastic bags and not other types of plastic, such as plastic wrap or packaging.

By following these steps, you can help reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans.
