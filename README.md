# BinBuddy
BinBuddy utilizes OpenAI's CLIPAI to help you determine how to properly recycle different types of waste just from a single photo. 

Once BinBuddy identifies the item and the material it's made of, it provides you with information on how to recycle it correctly.

BinBuddy's machine learning algorithms learn from user input. This ensures the app provides accurate and up-to-date information on how to recycle waste properly, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future.
